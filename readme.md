# Pure SPA

Back when I first started studing IT i figured I wanted to create a single page application. Only knowing JavaScript, being aware jQuery, but having felt the problems jQuery once solved, I figured lets go pure JS! Fast forward a few years and the desire to go back to an approach relying less on frameworks and libraries arises again.

_What do we need to have a working PWA?_ We need some way of knowing what content to show, preferable in a way that allowes a user to link to the correct content. We need some way to show the correct information.

## Navigation

On hash change and urls

## Templates
